POET Mission Development

In order to run the POET_scene_sim_example notebook, you need to download the stellar model grids used to calculate the source flux (https://kona.ubishops.ca/jsikora/poet_stellar_models.tar.gz) along with the instrument data containing the point spread function files (https://kona.ubishops.ca/jsikora/poet_instrument_data.tar.gz).
